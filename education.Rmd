Computer Programming Skills

•	I am proficient in Programming in Fortran and Python to solve advance problems in Physics. I am now upgrading the famous photoionization code named XSTAR to include time part in the calculations. Then we will parallelize the code to make it more efficient in terms of time. Finally, we will make it publicly available. Once we finish it, we will apply this code in the Active Galactic Nuclei Outflow, where the absorbing gas called “Warm Absorber” is expected to be at out of equilibrium.

•	I have taken a three-credit course in Data Base Management System in Computer Science Department, Western Michigan University.

•	I have good knowledge of query Language MySQL.

•	I have good knowledge of linear algebra packages, LAPACK, SCALAPACK and ODEPACK.

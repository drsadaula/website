My name is Dev Raj Sadaula. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Physics of Western Michigan University. 

I am working on upgrading the famous photoionization code named XSTAR to include time part in the calculations under the supervision of Dr. Manuel Bautista. Then we will parallelize the code to make it more efficient
in terms of time. 

Finally, we will make it publicly available. Once we finish it, we will
apply this code in the Active Galactic Nuclei Outflow, where the absorbing gas called
“Warm Absorber” is expected to be at out of equilibrium.
